## Description:
This repository contains the solution for the Coursework_2 of
[COMP0130 Robot Vision and Navigation (22/23)](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=30087)

## Questions:
The goal of this coursework is to gain experience with how a graphical-model based SLAM
system is implemented and assess its properties. The system will be implemented using the
MiniSLAM event-based framework you met in Topic 02 Lab 01 and the MATLAB port of the
g2o port you met in Topic 02 Lab 02.

  1). Implement the prediction and update steps using the vehicle process model, together with
      compass and GPS sensors. You will also investigate some general properties about how
      the graph optimizers work.

  2). Extend your implementation to undertake SLAM and explore some characteristics of how
the algorithm behaves.

3). Discuss ways improve the performance of the SLAM system. This also provides further
insight into how the graphs operate
